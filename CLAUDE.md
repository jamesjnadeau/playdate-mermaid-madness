# Working in this repo

## Response Notes

Before you respond, think if you should make any updates to this document that would help you be faster to respond in the future. Ask before making these updates to this document each time.

Please end your summaries with a suggested commit message for git.

If your change touches which scene the game boots into (`Config.START_SCENE`,
`main.lua`'s `sceneByName`, or `tools/simulate.sh`), ask whether the user
wants to run the Simulator with `MERMAID_START_SCENE` set to a scene that
makes testing the change easy, e.g. `MERMAID_START_SCENE=GameMain bash
tools/simulate.sh`.

## `source/scripts/` layout

`source/scripts/` is split into three subfolders by responsibility, rather
than one flat directory:

- **`player/`** — the player ship and anything it wields: `Player.lua`,
  `ConfigUpgrades.lua`, `Tridentball.lua` (the fired projectile),
  `StormCloud.lua` (the "Storm Cloud" upgrade's summoned hazard).
- **`enemies/`** — enemy classes: `Enemy.lua` (base class) and its
  subclasses (`EnemySwordfish.lua`, `EnemyKraken.lua`, `EnemyDummy.lua`),
  plus `ConfigEnemy.lua`.
- **`utilities/`** — everything shared or not specific to player/enemies:
  `Config.lua`, `Utils.lua`, `Ship.lua` (base class for both `Player` and
  `Enemy`), `MenuCard.lua`, `MusicPlayer.lua`, `Sound.lua`, `SoundBank.lua`.

New enemy scripts go in `enemies/` — `tools/new-enemy.sh` already targets
that folder. When adding a new script elsewhere, put it in whichever folder
matches its subject (player-specific, enemy-specific, or shared/utility);
update `import`/`dofile` paths throughout (`main.lua`, `source/scenes/*.lua`,
`tests/support/*.lua`) to match wherever it lands.

## Build/run verification

Don't try to locate or run the Playdate SDK compiler (`pdc`) or launch the
Simulator to verify changes — the user builds and runs this project
themselves. Static review (reading the diff, checking Lua syntax/logic by
eye) is still expected; just don't invoke the toolchain. If asked to
specifically run something, that's a direct request and fine to do.

This does *not* apply to `tests/run.sh` (see the `tests/` section below) —
it's a plain `lua5.4` script with no SDK/Simulator involved, so running it to
check pure-logic changes is expected, not just a direct-request exception.

## Type annotations (LuaCATS)

`source/scripts/**/*.lua` and `source/scenes/*.lua` (not `source/libraries/` —
that's vendored third-party code) carry
[LuaCATS](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) doc comments so
lua-language-server can type-check and autocomplete against the Playdate SDK.
This is editor-only tooling — plain comments, no effect on `pdc`/the compiled
`.pdx` — so it needs no build/CI wiring, unlike `tests/`.

- **Setup**: run `tools/fetch-luacats.sh` to vendor
  [notpeter/playdate-luacats](https://github.com/notpeter/playdate-luacats)
  (SDK type stubs) into `vendor/playdate-luacats/` (gitignored — editor
  tooling only, not a build/test dependency). `.luarc.json` at the repo root
  already points `workspace.library` at it; point your editor's Lua
  extension (e.g. the "Lua" extension by sumneko/LLS-Addons on VSCode) at
  this project and it picks the config up automatically.
- **Class pattern**: the Playdate SDK's `class("X").extends(Parent)` creates
  the global `X` as a side effect but returns `nil`, which LuaCATS can't see
  through. Every class in this repo follows the workaround from
  [Franchovy/Playdate-Guides](https://github.com/Franchovy/Playdate-Guides)'s
  `Type-checking-basics` guide:
  ```lua
  ---@class Enemy : Ship
  ---@field moveSpeed number
  Enemy = class("Enemy").extends(Ship) or Enemy
  ```
  The `or Enemy` is a no-op at runtime (`class()` already assigned the
  global; `extends()` returns `nil`, so the `or` falls through to the
  existing value) but gives LuaCATS the direct assignment it needs to attach
  the `---@class` type. Follow this pattern for any new class, including
  ones scaffolded by `tools/new-enemy.sh` (see below) — it doesn't add
  annotations for you.
- Fields assigned in `:init()` (or a table constructor) are inferred
  automatically from that assignment — don't re-declare them with `---@field`.
  Reserve `---@field` for fields a subclass is expected to set (e.g. `Ship`'s
  `length`/`hull`/`color`, filled in by `Player`/`Enemy`, not `Ship:init`
  itself) or fields set outside `:init()` (lazily-built caches like
  `Ship.bodyImage`, class-level statics like `Enemy.minLevel`).
- `Config.lua`/`ConfigEnemy.lua` are almost entirely flat `Config.FOO = value`
  assignments, which LuaCATS already infers without help — no `---@field`
  needed there. `ConfigUpgrades.lua` is the exception: its `Config.UPGRADES`
  entries have a real shape, so it defines `---@class Config.Upgrade` and
  types `Config.applyUpgrade` against it.

## Upgrade storage: mutates the global `Config` table directly

There's no separate "owned upgrades" list or per-player upgrade state.
`Config.applyUpgrade` (`source/scripts/player/ConfigUpgrades.lua`) mutates the
shared global `Config` table in place — e.g. picking "Twin Tridents" just
increments `Config.TRIDENT_COUNT`. Since `Config` is a module-level table
imported once from `main.lua` and never re-executed, this state is
process-global: it persists across every in-app scene transition (including
level-complete → upgrade-pick → next level, and previously, a game-over
restart) but not an actual app relaunch. Nothing here uses
`playdate.datastore`.

Because of that, `GameScene:onPlayerHealthDepleted` (the default game-over
handler; `GameSceneTraining` overrides it and deliberately skips this) calls
`Config.resetUpgrades()` to restore every `Config.UPGRADES`-touched field back
to the baseline value it had before any upgrade was ever applied (snapshotted
once at `ConfigUpgrades.lua` load time), so a fresh run after death doesn't
inherit the previous run's upgrades. If you add a new upgrade whose
`configKey` needs different reset semantics, do it in
`Config.resetUpgrades`, not by special-casing `onPlayerHealthDepleted`.

## Playdate system menu: 3-item cap

`playdate.getSystemMenu()` accepts at most **3 custom items total**, across
the whole game — this is a hardware/SDK constraint, not per-scene.
`addMenuItem`/`addCheckmarkMenuItem` don't error or warn when over the
limit; they silently no-op, so the only symptom is "the item isn't there."

Before adding any `playdate.getSystemMenu():addMenuItem`/
`addCheckmarkMenuItem` call, check how many other system-menu items could be
live at the same time. Prefer an in-scene [playout](source/libraries/playout.lua)-based
menu (see `source/scenes/EnemySelectScene.lua` / `source/scenes/SettingsScene.lua`
for the pattern) over the system menu when the setting doesn't need to be
reachable from the pause menu specifically.

History: this was first hit 2026-07-18 adding a "Select Enemy" system-menu
item to `GameSceneTraining.lua` alongside 3 always-on HUD-toggle checkmark items
from `main.lua` — the 4th item never appeared. It was fixed by moving the HUD
toggles (Wind Speed/Direction/Player Speed) out of the system menu entirely
into `SettingsScene.lua` (reached from `TitleScene`'s "Settings" item). At
that point three items were live, the full cap: `main.lua`'s "Music"
checkmark plus `GameSceneTraining`'s two scene-scoped items, "Select Enemy"
and "Test Upgrade".

The "Music" checkmark was later removed from the system menu too (moved into
`SettingsScene.lua`'s Sound section as a plain toggle, synced with
`Config.MUSIC_ENABLED` via `MusicPlayer.setEnabled`), freeing the cap back up
— not because the cap was hit again, but to make room for
`TuningScene.lua`'s three scene-scoped items ("Load Defaults"/"Load
Custom"/"Save Custom", added in `:start()`/removed in `:finish()`, same
pattern as `GameSceneTraining`'s). `SailingInstructions.lua` (added later)
adds a third scene-scoped pair on the same pattern, "Increase Wind
Speed"/"Decrease Wind Speed" (2 of 3). So as of now there are three scenes
that each use some or all of the 3-item cap on their own —
`GameSceneTraining` ("Select Enemy"/"Test Upgrade", 2 of 3), `TuningScene`
(all 3), and `SailingInstructions` ("Increase Wind Speed"/"Decrease Wind
Speed", 2 of 3) — but never at the same time as each other, since only one
scene is ever active. Adding an always-on item (like the old "Music"
checkmark) back in `main.lua` would collide with whichever scene-scoped set
is live; adding another scene-scoped item to any of these three requires
first removing one of its existing ones or moving it to an in-scene playout
menu instead (see the pattern note above).

## Rendered songs are one file each, looped natively

`tools/render-song.sh` renders a `.mid` to a single ADPCM `.wav` per song
for `source/scripts/utilities/MusicPlayer.lua`, which loops it via
`fileplayer:play(0)` (repeatCount 0 = loop forever). An earlier version
split each song into ~1-minute pieces and chained them with
`setFinishCallback`, reasoning that `playdate.sound.fileplayer` should only
have to open a small first piece — but `fileplayer:load()` doesn't actually
read from disk until `play()`/`setBufferSize()` is called, so a full-length
file is already cheap to open, and reloading a new piece at every boundary
produced an audible stutter (playback briefly stopping) that got more
jarring than the load cost it was avoiding. Single-file + native looping
has neither problem. (If songs are ever split again, split fluidsynth's raw
PCM output before ADPCM-encoding each piece, not an already-encoded
stream — ADPCM is delta-encoded/stateful, so cutting it at an arbitrary
byte offset leaves the next piece's predictor mismatched with what it
should have inherited, producing a click at the seam.)

## Sampled sound effects: SoundBank

`source/scripts/utilities/SoundBank.lua` plays a random sound from a folder of
pre-compiled audio, e.g. a handful of enemy-hit variations so repeated hits
don't all sound identical (see `Sound.playEnemyHit`, called from
`GameScene.lua`'s tridentball and StormCloud hit handling). It's a class
(`SoundBank(dir)`), not a singleton like `MusicPlayer` — instantiate one per
folder under `assets/sounds/`. Unlike `MusicPlayer`'s streamed
`playdate.sound.fileplayer` (built for long songs), `SoundBank` uses
`playdate.sound.sampleplayer`, which decompresses the whole clip into memory
up front — appropriate for short one-shots, not something you'd want for a
multi-minute song.

Raw source audio lives in `art-src/sounds/<group>/<name>.<ext>` (whatever
format, e.g. `.mp3`); `tools/render-sfx.sh` converts a folder of it into
compiled-ready `.wav` under `source/assets/sounds/<group>/<name>.wav` (pdc
auto-compiles those into `.pda` at build time, same as songs/images). To add
a new sound bank: drop source files in a new `art-src/sounds/<group>/`
folder, run `tools/render-sfx.sh art-src/sounds/<group>`, then
`SoundBank("assets/sounds/<group>")` and call `:playRandom()`.

## `tests/`

Plain-`lua5.4` unit tests — no Playdate SDK or Simulator involved. Two tiers:

- Pure-logic files that don't use `class("X").extends(...)` at all
  (`source/scripts/utilities/Utils.lua`, `Config.applyUpgrade` in
  `source/scripts/player/ConfigUpgrades.lua`) — loaded under `support/mock_playdate.lua`,
  a minimal `playdate`/`Particles` global stand-in.
- The scene system (`source/scenes/*.lua`, real files, not copies) — loaded
  under `support/mock_noble.lua`, a from-scratch stand-in for the Playdate
  SDK's `class()`/CoreLibs and for Noble Engine's `NobleScene`/`Noble.transition`/
  `Noble.Input`, plus `support/mock_game_scene.lua`, a lightweight test double
  for `source/scenes/GameScene.lua` (real `Ship`/`Enemy`/sprite/particle
  gameplay is still real-Simulator territory — the double keeps
  `GameSceneMain`/`GameSceneTraining`'s *own* logic real while swapping out
  everything they build on top of). See `tests/test_scene_flow.lua`'s header
  for the full rationale.

Both tiers are a floor, not a substitute for manual verification in the
Simulator — gameplay feel, rendering, and anything that isn't scene
transitions or pure logic still needs a human in the Simulator.

- **`run.sh`** — runs the suite (`lua5.4 tests/run_all.lua`), fetching
  `luaunit` first via `fetch-test-deps.sh` if `tests/vendor/luaunit.lua` isn't
  already present. Exits non-zero on any failure. Used both locally and by
  `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s `test` job, which the `build` job now
  depends on (`needs: test`) — a broken test blocks the compile/release
  steps.
- **`run_all.lua`** — loads `tests/support/mock_playdate.lua`, then every
  `tests/test_*.lua` file, then hands off to `luaunit.LuaUnit.run()`. Add new
  test files to the list here.
- **`support/mock_playdate.lua`** — the minimal `playdate`/`Particles` global
  stand-ins needed to `dofile` `Config.lua`/`ConfigUpgrades.lua`/`Utils.lua`
  outside the Simulator. Extend this if a future pure-logic script needs
  something it doesn't already stub.
- **`support/mock_noble.lua`** — stand-in for `class()`/`Object`/`NobleScene`/
  `Noble.transition`/`Noble.Input`/`playdate.graphics`/`kTextAlignment`/
  `playout`/`playdate.getSystemMenu()`/`playdate.sound.fileplayer`, narrow
  like `mock_playdate.lua`: only what `source/scenes/*.lua` (and
  `source/scripts/utilities/MusicPlayer.lua`, which `SettingsScene.lua` imports)
  actually touch. `Noble.transition`
  collapses the real engine's animated multi-frame swap into one synchronous
  call (same exit/finish/enter/start order); `Noble.Input.fire(eventName, ...)`
  is a test-only helper that simulates a button press by invoking that event
  on whichever inputHandler is currently active.
- **`support/mock_game_scene.lua`** — test double for `source/scenes/GameScene.lua`
  (see above). Extend this, not the real `GameScene.lua`, if a scene test
  needs another bit of the shared base scene's surface.
- **`support/load_scenes.lua`** — loads `mock_noble.lua`, the real
  `Config`/`ConfigEnemy`/`ConfigUpgrades`/`Utils` scripts, `mock_game_scene.lua`,
  then every real `source/scenes/*.lua` file, in `main.lua`'s import order
  (some scene files run code at load time that expects `GameScene` to
  already exist). `dofile`'d once from `test_scene_flow.lua`.
- **`test_scene_flow.lua`** — functional test of every transition in
  `source/scenes/Scenes.md`'s flow diagram, driven by `Noble.Input.fire`.
  Update this alongside `Scenes.md` when scene wiring changes.
- **`vendor/luaunit.lua`** — checked into git (like `pdParticles.lua`/
  `playout.lua` under `source/libraries/`), not gitignored; `fetch-test-deps.sh`
  is the bootstrap/fallback for a fresh clone missing it, mirroring
  `fetch-deps.sh`'s pattern. Honors `LUAUNIT_REF` to pin a branch/tag/commit
  instead of `master`.

## `source/scenes/Scenes.md`

One page per scene (purpose, entry points, controls, transitions out) plus a
mermaid diagram of the whole title-to-gameplay flow. **Keep it updated** —
whenever you add, remove, or rewire a scene (a new `Noble.transition` call, a
new scene file, a changed input binding that changes where a button leads),
update the matching section and diagram edge in `Scenes.md` in the same
change. `tests/test_scene_flow.lua` exercises the diagram's edges directly,
so a stale diagram and a stale test tend to go stale together — update both.

## `tools/`

- **`build.sh`** — `$PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH/bin/pdc source PesteringPoseidon.pdx`.
  Compiles `source/` into the `.pdx` bundle. Requires `PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH` to
  be set and `fetch-deps.sh` to have been run first (`pdc` will fail on
  missing `import`s otherwise). Per the build/run-verification note above,
  this is for the user to run, not something to invoke to check your own work.
- **`simulate.sh`** — `$PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH/bin/PlaydateSimulator PesteringPoseidon.pdx`.
  Launches the compiled bundle in the Playdate Simulator. Same caveat as
  `build.sh`: the user runs this themselves. If `MERMAID_START_SCENE` is set
  in the environment, forwards it as a launch argument so `main.lua` can pick
  a non-default boot scene — see `Config.START_SCENE` in
  `source/scripts/utilities/Config.lua` and the "Response Notes" section above.
- **`fetch-deps.sh`** — pulls the two vendored dependencies into
  `source/libraries/` if they aren't already present: Noble Engine (git clone)
  and pdParticles + playout (curl'd single files). Idempotent — safe to
  re-run, skips anything already fetched. Used both locally and by
  `.github/workflows/build.yml` in CI. Honors `NOBLE_REF` / `PARTICLES_REF` /
  `PLAYOUT_REF` env vars to pin a branch/tag/commit instead of `main`.
- **`fetch-test-deps.sh`** — same idea as `fetch-deps.sh` but for `tests/`:
  pulls `luaunit` into `tests/vendor/` if it isn't already present. Kept
  separate so a test-only dependency never ends up under `source/` (`pdc`
  would compile it into the `.pdx`). See the `tests/` section above.
- **`fetch-luacats.sh`** — same idea again, but for editor type checking:
  pulls `playdate-luacats` into `vendor/playdate-luacats/` (gitignored) if
  it isn't already present. Not wired into CI or `build.sh`/`tests/run.sh` —
  it's pure editor tooling, see the "Type annotations (LuaCATS)" section
  above. Honors `LUACATS_REF` to pin a branch/tag/commit instead of `main`.
- **`parse-check.sh`** — syntax-checks `source/scripts/`, `source/scenes/`,
  and `main.lua` with `luac5.4 -p` (compile-and-discard, no execution). Warns
  and exits 0 if `luac5.4` isn't on `PATH` rather than failing. Deliberately
  skips `source/libraries/`: those vendored files use `pdc`-only syntax (the
  `+=` family) plain `luac5.4` can't parse — see the "Type annotations
  (LuaCATS)" section above for the same distinction. Used both locally and by
  `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s `build` job (after `fetch-deps.sh`, its own
  "Install Lua" step providing `luac5.4` since the `build` job doesn't
  otherwise need lua5.4) as a fast fail-before-the-SDK-install gate.
  `tests/run.sh` already exercises `source/scenes/*.lua` for real (under the
  `mock_noble.lua` stand-in) as a stronger check than a bare parse, so this
  isn't a substitute for that, just a cheaper first check.
- **`new-enemy.sh <Name>`** — scaffolds a new `Enemy` subclass. Given a
  PascalCase or camelCase name (e.g. `Piranha`, `SeaSerpent`), it generates
  `source/scripts/enemies/Enemy<Name>.lua` (modeled on `EnemySwordfish.lua`, with
  TODOs for a distinct hull/look) and appends a matching
  `Config.ENEMY_<SNAKE_CASE_NAME>_*` tuning block to `ConfigEnemy.lua`
  (defaults mirror the base `ENEMY_*` values). Refuses to run if the target
  file or config section already exists. Prints the remaining manual wiring
  steps afterward (import in `main.lua`, add to `GameScene.enemyTypes`, tune
  the generated config block).
- **`render-song.sh [--piano | --program N] <input.mid> [output.wav]`** —
  renders a `.mid` to a single ADPCM `.wav` (fluidsynth + ffmpeg) for
  `source/scripts/utilities/MusicPlayer.lua` to play via
  `playdate.sound.fileplayer`, looped natively — see "Rendered songs are one
  file each, looped natively" above for why it's one file rather than
  split pieces. Requires `fluidsynth`/`ffmpeg` on `PATH` and a General MIDI
  soundfont (`SOUNDFONT` env var, defaults to Debian's `fluid-soundfont-gm`
  package); `--piano`/`--program` also need `python3` (drives
  `tools/midi_force_program.py`, which rewrites every track's GM program
  number in the `.mid` in place). Output is committed straight to
  `source/assets/songs/<song name>.wav` (~20MB for the bundled Mozart
  movement) rather than gitignored/regenerated in CI — rerun the script by
  hand if the source `.mid` changes.
- **`render-sfx.sh <input-dir> [output-dir]`** — converts a directory tree of
  source sound effects (any format `ffmpeg` reads, e.g. `art-src/sounds/**/*.mp3`)
  into mono, 44.1kHz ADPCM `.wav` files under `source/assets/sounds/`, one
  output file per input file, preserving the input's subdirectory structure.
  Simpler cousin of `render-song.sh`: no MIDI synthesis or piece-splitting,
  since each sound effect is already a short, standalone clip. Defaults the
  output dir to the input's own path under `source/assets/sounds` (e.g.
  `art-src/sounds/enemy/hit` → `source/assets/sounds/enemy/hit`), so the
  common case needs no second argument. Requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. See
  `SoundBank.lua` below for how the converted folders get played back.
